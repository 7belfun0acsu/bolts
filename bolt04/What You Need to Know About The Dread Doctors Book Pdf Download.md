The Dread Doctors are not only the title of a book, but also the name of a group of sinister scientists who appeared as the main villains in Season 5 of Teen Wolf, a popular supernatural drama series. The Dread Doctors were obsessed with creating the perfect killer by resurrecting the legendary Beast of Gevaudan, a monstrous werewolf that terrorized France in the 18th century.
 
To achieve their goal, the Dread Doctors experimented on teenagers who had two sets of DNA, making them natural chimeras. They used a combination of science and magic to turn them into hybrid creatures with various supernatural abilities, such as werewolves, kanimas, wendigos, and more. However, most of their experiments failed and resulted in death or madness for their subjects.
 
The Dread Doctors also manipulated the memories of anyone who encountered them, making them forget their existence and their actions. They wore steampunk-style masks and outfits that concealed their true appearance and enhanced their abilities. They were ruthless, cold, and cruel in their pursuit of their twisted vision.

The only person who knew about the Dread Doctors and their plans was Dr. Gabriel Valack, a former Eichen House inmate who had written the book about them under a pseudonym. He used his book as a way to trigger the memories of those who had been affected by the Dread Doctors, hoping to expose them and stop them. However, his book also had negative effects on some readers, such as Lydia Martin , who suffered from terrifying visions and hallucinations after reading it.
 
The Dread Doctors were eventually defeated by Scott McCall and his pack , who managed to save Mason Hewitt , the host of the Beast's spirit, and destroy the source of the Dread Doctors' power. The Surgeon , the leader of the Dread Doctors, was killed by Theo Raeken , one of their former experiments who had betrayed them. The Pathologist and The Geneticist were killed by Parrish , a Hellhound who was destined to fight the Beast.
